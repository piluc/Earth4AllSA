# Earth4AllSA Notebook
Notebook associated to the paper *Making the World Better with Fewer Turnarounds. A sensitivity analysis of the Earth for All model* and based on the Julia implementation of the [Earth4All model](https://earth4all.life/the-science-rp/) using the [WorldDynamics framework](https://github.com/worlddynamics/WorldDynamics.jl) and referring to the [April 2023 Vensim version](https://web.archive.org/web/20220830093115/https://earth4all.life/the-science/) available [here](https://stockholmuniversity.app.box.com/s/uh7fjh52pvh7yx1mqfwqcyxdcvegrodf/folder/170558692760). A list of the variables, equations and parameters of this implementation is available [here](https://www.pilucrescenzi.it/e4asa/e4a.html).
